            <p>The Mocambo Neighborhood was a sanctuary for its African residents because it gave them autonomy in terms of housing and cultural expression. Nevertheless, as time went on, this area underwent several name changes and its reputation diminished, thus contributing to its African past being forgotten.

While the mass burial pit has been gone since the 18th century, the neighborhood of  Mocambo became a center for African life. The cross street of Rua Poco dos Negros is “Jewish Crossing,” yet another of the neighborhood’s cosmopolitan, marginal, and laboring past. A 2020 namesake rap album 'Rua do Poco dos Negros'  by Portuguese hiphop artist and former Benfica resident Valete (born Keidje Torres Lima) addresses the history and current implications of race relations in Portugal.</p>

It is important to remember this site as historical and significant but also a place of anguish and despair.</p>
